# Síntesis

## Puntos clave
- The immune response comprises not only pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory pathways but also pro-resolution mechanisms that serve to balance the need of the host to target microbial pathogens while preventing excess inflammation and bystander tissue damage.

- Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) are lipid mediators derived from poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) which have been demonstrated to have an important role in the inflammation environment, preventing an overreaction of the organism and promoting the resolution of inflammation

- Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) are enzymatically derived from essential fatty acids to serve as a novel class of immunoresolvents that limit acute responses and orchestrate the clearance of tissue pathogens, dying cells and debris from the battlefield of infectious inflammation.

- SPMs are composed of lipoxins, E-series and D-series resolvins, protectins and maresins. Individual members of the SPM family serve as agonists at cognate receptors to induce cell-type specific responses

- Important regulatory roles for SPMs have been uncovered in host responses to several microorganisms, including bacterial, viral, fungal and parasitic pathogens.

- SPMs also promote the resolution of non-infectious inflammation and tissue injury. Defects in host SPM pathways contribute to the development of chronic inflammatory diseases.

- With the capacity to enhance host defence and modulate inflammation, SPMs represent a promising translational approach to enlist host resolution programmes for the treatment of infection and excess inflammation.

- Defects in the SPM pathways, such as defects in receptor expression, enzyme synthesis, intracellular signalling or nutritional deficiencies in essential polyunsaturated fatty acids, can undermine resolution and contribute to chronic inflammation. 

- SPMs are active in the picogram to nanogram dose range, whereby they are able to control inflammation, limit tissue damage, shorten resolution intervals, promote healing and alleviate pain in experimental models of inflammation and resolution

## Proceso inflamatorio

Acute inflammation is initiated within seconds of pathogen detection. Granulocytes are rapidly recruited to sites of infection, where they become activated and augment the resident capacity of infected tissue to kill and ultimately clear the pathogen. These early events are coordinated by several families of pro-inflammatory mediators, including lipid mediators (such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes), cytokines and chemokines. These pro-inflammatory mediators have overlapping and distinct functions and ultimately induce an increase in vascular permeability and orchestrate leukocyte recruitment. 

This leads to the cardinal signs of tissue inflammation — namely calor (fiebre), rubor, tumor (hinchazon/edema), dolor and potentially functio laesa.

Many of these SPMs are produced during the acute inflammatory response. 

Typically, acute inflammatory responses to pathogens are self-limiting, and there is a growing appreciation that SPMs have pivotal anti-inflammatory and anti-infective roles in tissue catabasis. For effective resolution of inflammation to occur in tissues, cessation of granulocyte recruitment is required in conjunction with the recruitment and differentiation of macrophages, which help clear inflammatory cells and tissue debris to restore tissue homeostasis. Granulocytes in the tissue undergo apoptosis during the resolution of inflammation to prevent bystander tissue injury occurring from the release of potentially toxic cellular contents. Removal of apoptotic neutrophils prompts a switch from a pro- to an anti-inflammatory macrophage phenotype, which is a prerequisite for macrophage efferocytosis and egress via the lymphatic vessels. Efferocytosis also leads to further production of additional SPMs that signal for restoration of vascular integrity, regeneration and/or repair of injured tissues, remission of fever by inhibition of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators and cytokines, and relief of inflammatory pain.

Together, the SPMs and these cellular events in resolution can be summarized as the newly recognized five cardinal signs of resolution: removal (of microorganisms, dead cells and debris), restoration (of vascular integrity and perfusion), regeneration (of tissue), remission (of fever) and relief (from inflammatory pain).

### Creación de SPMs
In response to pathogen invasion or tissue injury, polyunsaturated fatty acids are released locally from membrane phospholipids or delivered to sites of inflammation by tissue oedema for subsequent conversion to specialized mediators by cells in the exudates.

Within minutes, the generation of eicosanoids (that is, prostaglandins and cysteinyl leukotrienes) from arachidonic acid (C20:4n-6) metabolism helps to direct peripheral blood neutrophils to infected sites. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and PGI2 regulate blood flow, whereas leukotriene C4 (LTC4) and LTD4 regulate vascular permeability. Furthermore, neutrophils transmigrate towards chemotactic gradients of LTB4. 

With selected cytokines, chemokines and complement components (namely C5a and C3b), these eicosanoids induce neutrophil entry into the tissue to engulf and kill invading pathogens.

Early in the acute inflammatory response, the origins are laid for biosynthesis of resolution-phase mediators through lipid mediator class-switching, in which arachidonic acid metabolism switches from the production of leukotrienes to the production of lipoxins — the lead family of pro-resolving mediators26. Disruption of lipoxin formation or lipoxin receptor availability delays the resolution response.

As a class, the SPMs are enzymatically derived from essential fatty acids, including arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; C20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; C22:6n-3) in a lipoxygenase (LOX)-dependent manner. 

Although aspirin inhibits prostaglandin production, aspirin-mediated acetylation of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2; also known as PTGS2) leads to the conversion of arachidonic acid to 15(R)-HETE, which can serve as a substrate for 5-LOX-mediated conversion to 15-epi-lipoxins (also known as aspirin-triggered (AT) lipoxins). Of note, in the absence of aspirin, 15(R)-HETE can also be produced by cytochrome P450 enzymes to act as a substrate for 15-epi-lipoxin transcellular biosynthesis.

In addition to lipoxins, resolving exudates also contain pro-resolving mediators derived from omega-3 fatty acids. These include resolvins, protectins and maresins. E-series and D-series resolvins are enzymatically derived from EPA and DHA, respectively. Similarly to 15-epi-lipoxins, resolvins are generated through interactions between aspirin-acetylated COX2 and LOX activities. 

For example, in the vasculature, resolvin E1 (RvE1) transcellular synthesis in the presence of aspirin is notable for transformation of EPA to 18(R)-HEPE by aspirin-acetylated COX2 in endothelial cells and 18(R)-HEPE conversion to RvE1 by leukocyte 5-LOX. There are two major series of resolvins that are derived from DHA, namely D-series resolvins (RvD1–RvD6) and their positional AT isomers (AT-RvD1–RvD6)42. The D-series resolvins are enzymatically generated by 15-LOX-mediated conversion of DHA to 17(S)-hydroperoxyDHA (17(S)-HpDHA) and subsequent transformation by 5-LOX. For the AT-resolvins, DHA is initially converted by aspirin-acetylated COX2 to 17(R)-HpDHA that can also serve as a substrate for 5-LOX-mediated transformation to epimeric resolvins.

Additional families of pro-resolution mediators derived from DHA have also been identified in resolving inflammatory exudates that display protective bioactivities, namely protectins and maresins.

Defects in these SPM pathways can undermine resolution and contribute to chronic inflammation. Failure of the resolution response may occur as a result of defects in receptor expression, enzyme synthesis, intracellular signalling or nutritional deficiencies in essential polyunsaturated fatty acids.

# SPMs functions
These SPMs display potent receptor-mediated cell-specific actions. 

SPMs are active in the picogram to nanogram dose range, whereby they are able to control inflammation, limit tissue damage, shorten resolution intervals, promote healing and alleviate pain in experimental models of inflammation and resolution

**Neutrophils**. For tissue resolution of inflammation, it is essential to prevent further neutrophil entry, inhibit tissue neutrophil activation and promote the clearance of apoptotic neutrophils. All of these cellular actions are mediated by SPMs. 

**Macrophages**. Both tissue-resident and recruited inflammatory macrophages serve pivotal roles in responses to infection and inflammation. SPMs augment macrophage functions to clear microorganisms, tissue debris and apoptotic cells. Key macrophage actions for SPMs include increased phagocytosis and IL-10 production and decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine production.

**Natural killer cells**. Natural killer (NK) cells can help promote the resolution of an inflammatory response by inducing neutrophil and eosinophil apoptosis, which is a non-inflammatory mechanism for cell removal from tissues and has a crucial role in successful resolution of the inflammatory response. Apoptotic granulocytes can subsequently be removed by tissue macrophage efferocytosis before tissues are exposed to their potentially toxic contents. By accelerating granulocyte apoptosis, NK cells can limit pathogen-mediated inflammatory responses. NK cells express ALX67, and LXA4 increases NK cell-mediated apoptosis of eosinophils and neutrophils. NK cells also express CMKLR1, which is the receptor for RvE1, and NK cell depletion markedly impairs the protective actions of RvE1 in vivo.

**Innate lymphoid cells**. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) are members of the family of innate-like leukocytes. ILC2s do not express T cell or B cell antigen receptors, or markers of other leukocyte lineages, but they serve important roles for host defence against helminth infections. Similarly to NK cells, ILC2s express receptors for pro-resolving mediators, including LXA4 and RvE1. LXA4 and MaR1 can potently inhibit ILC2 release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. MaR1 also promotes amphiregulin release by ILC2s, a protective response for restoring lung mucosal homeostasis after influenza infection.

**Lymphocytes**. Adaptive immune cells also have important roles in the active resolution of inflammation. CCR5 expression on apoptotic, activated T cells acts to sequester pro-inflammatory cytokines and terminate inflammation; a mechanism that is augmented by SPMs. RvE1 decreases the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-23 and IL-17, to dampen the adaptive immune response, particularly T helper 17 (TH17) cell responses. Regulatory T cells are pivotal to controlling effector T cell proliferation and activation. Of note, MaR1 was recently identified as a potent inducer for the formation of regulatory T cells in vivo and in vitro in combination with TGFβ70. Only limited information is available on SPM actions on B cells, but RvD1 was recently shown to augment B cell antibody production and increase the number of antibody-producing B cells in a mouse influenza vaccination model. These emerging data on the regulation of adaptive immunity by SPMs extend their range of actions and suggest a pivotal role for these imunoresolvents in the transition from innate to adaptive inflammation.

**Mucosal epithelial cells**. In mucosal host defence, transmigrating neutrophils initiate a respiratory burst and degranulation response to invading pathogens; however, excessive neutrophil activation can cause 'bystander' tissue damage and contribute to pathobiology of mucosal inflammatory disease. During resolution, the activated neutrophils are cleared apically from the intestinal lumin by decay accelerating factor (also known as CD55), which is an anti-adhesive molecule. SPMs potently inhibit neutrophil trans-epithelial migration and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by epithelial cells. In addition, SPMs promote decay accelerating factor expression in mucosal epithelia as well as expression of the anti-infective peptide bactericidal permeability-increasing protein and the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) detoxification enzyme alkaline phosphatase.

# Other pro-resolution molecules
These fatty acid-derived mediators are part of a larger resolution programme that includes annexin A1 protein16, several cytokines (for example, transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) and interleukin-10 (IL-10)), microRNAs and carbon monoxide. Inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases can also pharmacologically promote resolution.
